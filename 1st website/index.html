     <h3 class="about">Hopefully one day a fullstack software developer</h3>
        <p>I don't have a big experience in programming, but I am very willing to learn new things. So hopefully one day I will be a real software developer. </p>
        <p>As for other things I like, one of them is history and the other one hiking, being outside, in the countryside and enjoying the clean air and body activity.</p>

        <h4>Logic gate</h4>
            <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it <strong>performs a logical operation</strong> on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>

        <h4>ASCII code</h4> 
            <p>It stands for <strong>American Standard Code for Information Interchange</strong>. 
            Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>

        <h4>RAM</h4>    
            <p>It is a form of computer data storage which <strong>stores frequently used program instructions</strong> to increase the general speed of a system. <br>
            It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>

        <h4>Programming language</h4>   
            <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. 
            They generally consist of <strong>instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs</strong> that implement specific algorithms.</p>

        <h4>DNS or Domain Name System</h4>   
            <p>A <strong>hierarchical decentralized naming system</strong> for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. 
            It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.</p>

        <h4>HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h4>   
            <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the <strong>foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web</strong>. 
            It is the <strong>standard protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext</strong>.</p>
