        <h2>Review movie Harry Potter 1</h2>
        <p>I have read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone nine times and my brother Ben, who is 10, has read it five times. When I heard that there was going to be a film I was really worried that it wouldn't be anything like I had imagined it. But I needn't have been so worried. I spent the first 20 minutes noticing some of the things they had missed out but then I decided just to sit back and enjoy it.</p>

        <h2>Review Rush movie</h2>
        <p>Surprisingly really good and even it being a true story makes it even more amazing, the cast do really good for what they're given, especially James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki (Daniel Br√ºhl) they give probably the best performances throughout. Also, the makeup artists do a fantastic job with certain characters and it honestly looks real for the most part, which is really good.</p>
